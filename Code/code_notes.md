10/13 - RA
    added a gui test to the github
    includes tab style organization of the interface
    also tried to build out some of the basic parts of the search interface

10/31 - planning
    we should try to have the ui done by the end of this sprint so we can focus on other things

    R - I have and plan to work a bit on the UI today:
        the recipe page
            figure out scrollable panes

        fix the search page layout
            make elements fill the pane
            shift everything so it is in the right spots(search bar on top, filters on left, results in the middle(?) of the screen)
