10/13 - RA
    added a gui test to the github
    includes tab style organization of the interface
    also tried to build out some of the basic parts of the search interface

10/31 - planning
    we should try to have the ui done by the end of this sprint so we can focus on other things

    R - I have and plan to work a bit on the UI today:
        the recipe page
            figure out scrollable panes

        fix the search page layout
            make elements fill the pane
            shift everything so it is in the right spots(search bar on top, filters on left, results in the middle(?) of the screen)

11/12 - GUI
    R - made changes to the way the search tab was implemented so it works with the tab style ui
            made new TabFrameTemplate superclass for the tabs
            worked on the notes tab

11/12 - GUI
    R - worked on note tab(also a bit on the recipe tab the day prior)
        haven't been able to get the saveNote() function work; im having problems with checking if the note is already in the list of saved notes
